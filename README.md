# FiveM Los Santos International Airport Reform
This is for Los Santos Internation Airport. This is a script that takes away all the static planes from their position. 

► How to setup and configure? ◄
- Simply just start the resource! This clears up majority of LSIA.

► Disclaimer ◄
- The old maker of this ymap addition deleted his name fully therefore I have no clue who started this. However this is an **addon** removal of shit like trash etc. [THIS PICTURE IS NOT SHOWING STATIC PLANES IT IS SHOWING PLAYERS FROM MY SERVER]
